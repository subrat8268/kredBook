## Drift Watchlist

- Legacy internals still use `order` / `party` — label as `legacy/transitional` if referenced.
- `customers` and `suppliers` tables dropped; all data now in `parties`.
- Legacy supplier/product tables have been dropped from `public` (e.g., `products`, `supplier_*`).
- `order_items.product_id` / `order_items.variant_id` remain as nullable legacy columns; treat them as transitional.
- `parties` is customers-only now (`parties_is_customer_only`). Supplier fields have been removed.
- `profiles.dashboard_mode` has been removed.
- Supplier / product surfaces are out of scope and must not be described as active features.

---

### Phase 3 — Task Notes

#### 3.11 — Customer Search Improvements ✅ Done

**Implemented the People search upgrade end-to-end with smoother input handling and better matching.**

- Added 250ms debounced search input in `app/(main)/people/index.tsx` so typing doesn't trigger immediate heavy updates on every keypress.
- Added fuzzy/prefix matching (includes, token-prefix, and ordered-char fallback) so queries like `raj` match `Rajesh Kumar` in `app/(main)/people/index.tsx`.
- Added search result count label: `X of Y customers` in `app/(main)/people/index.tsx`.
- Added matched substring highlight in customer name by passing a rich title node into `ListItem`:
  - `src/components/layer2/ListItem.tsx` now supports `titleNode?: React.ReactNode`
  - `app/(main)/people/index.tsx` renders highlighted text using theme primary color.
- Consolidated duplicate data-fetch logic by switching `usePeople` to reuse API fetch logic:
  - `src/hooks/usePeople.ts` now uses `fetchPeople` from `src/api/people.ts` instead of maintaining a second parallel fetch implementation.

**Files changed:** `app/(main)/people/index.tsx`, `src/components/layer2/ListItem.tsx`, `src/hooks/usePeople.ts`

**Verification:** `npm run lint` passes with 0 errors (existing warnings remain in unrelated files).

---

#### 3.12 — Entries + People Filters ✅ Done

**Plan: List Filter Chips**

**Overview:** Add client-side filter chips to both People and Entries screens, with URL-safe state so links can restore the active filter. Keep all filtering local to cached React Query data and avoid new DB calls.

**Tasks:**

| # | Task | Type | Estimate | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Inspect current list state, routing, and existing filter helpers in People and Entries screens | Research | 15m | - |
| 2 | Define a shared URL-safe filter schema for each screen (peopleFilter, entriesFilter, plus custom range params) | Design | 30m | 1 |
| 3 | Add People filter chips: All, Overdue, Pending, Paid, Advance | UI | 30m | 2 |
| 4 | Add Entries filter chips: All, Overdue, Pending, Paid, This Month, Custom Range | UI | 45m | 2 |
| 5 | Wire both screens to read/write filter state from params so deep links restore correctly | Navigation/State | 1 hr | 2 |
| 6 | Keep filtering client-side from existing React Query cache, with no extra fetches | Data flow | 30m | 1 |
| 7 | Make Custom Range param-safe and restoreable from link state | State/Navigation | 45m | 2, 5 |
| 8 | Verify empty states, result counts, and active filter labels still behave correctly | QA | 30m | 3, 4, 5 |
| 9 | Run lint and sanity-check deep-link behavior | Verification | 15m | 3-8 |

**Execution Order:**
1. Confirm the current filter and route patterns.
2. Define the shared param contract.
3. Implement People chips.
4. Implement Entries chips.
5. Connect deep-linkable param state.
6. Validate client-side filtering only.
7. Test restore behavior from URLs.

**Risks:**
- Custom Range can become ambiguous unless the param shape is fixed up front.
- People and Entries may use different route param conventions, so the shared contract needs to stay simple.
- Deep-link support may require normalizing empty/default states carefully.

**Success Criteria:**
- Both screens expose the requested chip sets.
- Filter state survives refresh/deep link navigation.
- No new DB queries are added.
- Lint passes.

### Phase 3 — OpenCode Prompts

#### 3.13 — Export Hardening

```
/audit load_skills=["supabase","code-reviewer"]

Audit CSV export for correctness and locale safety.
- Validate that exported totals match on-screen totals (spot-check 3 customers)
- Confirm all amounts use formatINR — no raw toLocaleString calls remaining
- Confirm date formatting is consistent (DD MMM YYYY) across export rows
- Flag any rows that may produce broken CSV if customer name has a comma
Deliver an audit report only. Fixes go in a follow-up /fix task.
```

- Audit report: `docs/audits/csv-export-audit-2026-05-03.md`
- Outcome: totals spot-check passed for 3/3 customers; locale/date inconsistencies found in CSV rows; CSV escaping is safe for commas/quotes/newlines.
- Follow-up `/fix` complete: CSV row amounts now use `formatINR` and CSV row dates now use `DD MMM YYYY` via shared formatter.

---

## Phase 4 — UI/UX Redesign ⏳ Not Started

**Goal:** Full design system overhaul and screen-by-screen redesign. Vercel × Khatabook × Linear aesthetic. Bharat-market ready.

> **Depends On:** Phase 3 task 3.1 (dark mode tokens) must be ✅ Done first — Phase 4.0 builds on top of those token foundations.
> **Rule:** Never start a screen redesign without 4.0 (design system) being ✅ Done. All tokens must be locked before touching any screen.

---

### Phase 4.0 — Design System Foundation ⚠️ Blocks All Other 4.x Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Priority | Command | Skills | Depends On |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.0.1 | Update `theme.ts` — new color tokens (green primary, amber accent, semantic palette) | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/refactor` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `building-native-ui`, `react-native-skills` | 3.1 ✅ |
| 4.0.2 | Fix `tailwind.config.js` — replace CSS vars with literal token values | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/fix` | `refactor-engineer`, `expo-tailwind-setup`, `react-native-skills` | 4.0.1 ✅ |
| 4.0.3 | Add motion tokens — `duration-fast: 150ms`, `duration-base: 250ms`, easing curves | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `react-native-skills` | 4.0.1 ✅ |
| 4.0.4 | Unify icon system — migrate all icons to `lucide-react-native`, remove SVG + system mix | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/refactor` | `refactor-engineer`, `code-reviewer` | 4.0.1 ✅ |
| 4.0.5 | Rebuild `StatusBadge` — filled pill + semantic color per status (Paid/Partial/Overdue/Advance) | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `sleek-design-mobile-apps` | 4.0.1 ✅ |
| 4.0.6 | Rebuild `Button` variants — primary / secondary / ghost / danger with new tokens | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `react-native-skills` | 4.0.1 ✅ |
| 4.0.7 | Create `Skeleton` component — shimmer loading for all list/card surfaces | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `react-native-skills` | 4.0.1 ✅ |
| 4.0.8 | Create `SpeedDialFAB` component — expandable FAB (New Entry · New Customer · Record Payment) | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `react-native-skills` | 4.0.3 ✅ |

**New Brand Tokens (implement in 4.0.1):**

Current `theme.ts` uses blue (`#2563EB`) as primary. Phase 4 migrates to:

```
primary:    #16A34A  (green-600)   → trust, money, growth
accent:     #F59E0B  (amber-500)   → overdue alerts, urgency
surface:    #F9FAFB  (gray-50)     → card backgrounds
ink:        #111827  (gray-900)    → primary text
muted:      #6B7280  (gray-500)    → secondary text
danger:     #DC2626  (red-600)     → errors, delete
success:    #16A34A                → same as primary (paid status)
warning:    #F59E0B                → overdue
border:     #E5E7EB  (gray-200)    → dividers
```

**Typography upgrade (implement in 4.0.1):**
- Body / numbers: **Inter** (already in use — no change)
- Headings: **Manrope** (new — replace screenTitle/sectionTitle Inter instances)

**Dead code to kill in 4.0 (before redesign starts):**
- Center FAB tab from `(main)/_layout.tsx` — replace with SpeedDialFAB
- Standalone Export tab — move to Profile screen
- `src/components/navigation/` (empty directory)
- Stub product picker state in `create.tsx` lines 91–103
- `role.tsx` unregistered route in onboarding `_layout.tsx`
- Wired-but-unused i18n `t()` calls — either fully wire or remove

#### 4.0.1 — Update theme.ts OpenCode Prompt

```
/refactor load_skills=["ui-ux-pro-max","building-native-ui","react-native-skills","code-reviewer"]

Migrate KredBook brand tokens in src/utils/theme.ts from blue-primary to green-primary.

2. Add accent token: #F59E0B (amber-500) for overdue/urgency surfaces
3. Update heroGradients: dashboardHero + customerHero/peopleHero to use green-700→green-800
4. Keep danger (#DC2626), warning (#F59E0B = accent), success (#16A34A = primary) — all correct
5. Add motion tokens object: { fast: 150, base: 250, slow: 400, easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)' }
6. Add Manrope font family entries alongside existing Inter entries
7. Update lightColors + darkColors to reflect all above changes
8. Keep all existing token names — only values change. No component edits in this task.

Verification: theme.ts exports unchanged API shape, no TS errors, lint clean.
```

### Phase 4.4 — Profile, Export + Public Ledger

> Depends On: 4.0 ✅ Done, 4.2 ✅ Done

| # | Task | Status | Priority | Command | Skills | Screen |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.4.1 | Profile screen redesign — editable header, UPI QR, app settings section, danger zone | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `react-native-skills` | `(main)/profile/index.tsx` |
| 4.4.2 | Profile Edit redesign — logo upload, UPI ID, address, sticky save bar, inline validation | ⏳ Not Started | P2 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `react-native-skills` | `(main)/profile/edit.tsx` |
| 4.4.3 | Export — move from standalone tab into Profile, add customer filter, email export, export history | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/refactor` | `refactor-engineer`, `react-native-skills` | `(main)/export/index.tsx` |
| 4.4.4 | Public Ledger redesign — business logo, UPI Pay Now button, WhatsApp CTA, mobile-responsive, KredBook footer | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `project-planner` | `app/l/[token].tsx` |

#### 4.4.4 — Public Ledger OpenCode Prompt

```
/build load_skills=["ui-ux-pro-max","project-planner","code-reviewer"]

Redesign the Public Ledger screen (app/l/[token].tsx). This is a B2C touchpoint — customers receive this link via WhatsApp.

Changes:
1. Show vendor business logo + name prominently at top
2. Outstanding amount hero: large, clear, "₹2,400 is due" — no ambiguity
3. Transaction timeline: clean, date-grouped
4. UPI Pay Now button: if vendor has UPI ID, deep-link to UPI apps (upi://pay?pa=...)
5. "Talk to Us" WhatsApp CTA linking to vendor phone
6. Expiry warning if token has TTL: "Link valid for X days"
7. Subtle "Powered by KredBook" footer
8. Fully mobile-responsive — renders cleanly in mobile browsers (customers open from WhatsApp)

Verification: renders on mobile viewport, UPI deep link fires, WhatsApp CTA works, lint clean.
```

## Phase 5 — Documents + Collection ⏳ Not Started

**Goal:** PDF outputs and UPI collection links for WhatsApp-first sharing.

| # | Task | Status | Priority | Command | Skills |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | PDF Customer statement — Edge Function generates PDF, stores in Supabase Storage, share via WhatsApp | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/build` | `supabase`, `project-planner` |
| 5.2 | Entry PDF — single Entry receipt shareable via WhatsApp | ⏳ Not Started | P2 | `/build` | `supabase`, `project-planner` |
| 5.3 | UPI collect link + QR on Customer balance screen | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/build` | `project-planner`, `react-native-skills` |
| 5.4 | Receipt-friendly sharing flow — polish and test end-to-end | ⏳ Not Started | P2 | `/plan` | `project-planner`, `writing-plans` |
| 5.5 | Referral prompt after successful payment — lightweight share + deep link | ⏳ Not Started | P3 | `/build` | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `project-planner` |

## Phase 6 — AI Assistance ⏳ Not Started

**Goal:** Opt-in AI features only. All AI goes through Supabase Edge Functions with guardrails.

> **Rule:** No AI feature is added without an opt-in UX. All AI calls are rate-limited and audit-logged. No AI feature modifies data directly.
> **Depends On:** Phase 4 (UI/UX Redesign) ✅ Done preferred — AI surfaces must use the new design system tokens.

| # | Task | Status | Priority | Command | Skills |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Plan AI architecture — Edge Function boundary, guardrails, rate limits | ⏳ Not Started | P0 | `/plan` | `project-planner`, `writing-plans`, `supabase` |
| 6.2 | Follow-up prioritization — rank Customers by overdue + recency | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/build` | `project-planner`, `supabase` |
| 6.3 | Smart Customer summary — last 30 days entries/payments + suggested action | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/build` | `supabase`, `project-planner` |
| 6.4 | AI WhatsApp draft — generate EN/HI message variants with opt-in UX | ⏳ Not Started | P1 | `/plan` | `project-planner`, `writing-plans` |
| 6.5 | Anomaly detection — flag customers with 45+ days no payment | ⏳ Not Started | P2 | `/plan` | `project-planner`, `supabase` |
| 6.6 | Monthly insight card — collection trend summary | ⏳ Not Started | P2 | `/build` | `supabase`, `project-planner` |
