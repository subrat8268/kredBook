# Agent Notes (KredBook)

If any repo instruction conflicts, `SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md` wins.

## Non-negotiables

- Canonical product nouns: Customer / Entry / Payment. Screens: Dashboard / People / Entries / Profile.
- Legacy/transitional terms exist in code (ex: `order`, `party`); label them `legacy`/`transitional` if you must mention them.
- Design tokens: `src/utils/theme.ts` is source of truth (Tailwind/NativeWind derives from it via `tailwind.config.js`).
- Database/schema: don't guess; use Supabase MCP and put DDL in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Any code change that affects behavior, flows, setup, or developer workflow must update related docs in `docs/` and/or `README.md` in the same task.

## MCP Rules

- **Notion MCP**: ignore — not used in this project. Never read/write Notion.
- **Supabase MCP**: use for all DB introspection, RLS checks, and migrations. Never guess schema; always call the MCP first.
- **Context7 MCP**: use for all library/SDK/API/framework docs (see instructions below). Covers Expo, React Native, Supabase JS, NativeWind, TanStack Query, Zustand, etc.
- **Stitch MCP**: disabled — ignore.

## Context Budget Rules

- Never read `package-lock.json` — it is noise, skip it entirely.
- Never read full `schema.sql` to inspect one table — use Supabase MCP `list_tables` or `execute_sql` instead.
- For any component change: read only the target file + its direct imports, not the entire `src/` tree.
- `docs/STATUS.md` is the task tracker — read only the current phase section, not the full file.
- `.agents/skills/` — load only the skill(s) relevant to the current task, not all 26 at once.
- `src/utils/theme.ts` is authoritative for all token values — read it once per session, don't re-read on every subtask.

## How To Run

- Package manager is npm (repo has `package-lock.json`): `npm ci`.
- Dev server: `npm run start`.
- Device builds (generates gitignored `/ios` + `/android`): `npm run ios` / `npm run android`.
- Lint: `npm run lint` (runs `expo lint`).
- Tests: none are currently checked in (no `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*` files and no `test` script).

## Repo Wiring That Bites

- Expo Router entrypoint is `app/_layout.tsx`; it owns the auth/profile/phone/onboarding redirect logic. Be careful when changing login/onboarding flows.
- Offline-first is real: React Query cache persists to MMKV, and Supabase mutations may be wrapped/queued on network failure (`src/services/supabase.ts`, `src/lib/syncQueue.ts`). Don't "fix" errors by removing queue behavior.
- Required runtime env vars (from code): `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Optional: `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`.
- `.env*` is gitignored; never commit it.
- `.github/` is gitignored in this repo; don't rely on CI workflows being present.
- NativeWind styles must be routed through `src/utils/theme.ts` — never hardcode color/spacing values anywhere in components. Use `expo-tailwind-setup` skill when touching styles.
- React Query + MMKV offline cache is critical infrastructure. Use `native-data-fetching` skill for any data-layer work.

## Toolchain Quirks

- NativeWind is enabled via `global.css` + `tailwind.config.js`; Babel uses `nativewind/babel`.
- `react-native-reanimated/plugin` must stay last in `babel.config.js`.
- Metro is configured for SVG imports as React components (`react-native-svg-transformer`) in `metro.config.js`.

## OpenCode Workflow

- Command-first prompts: `/plan`, `/build`, `/fix`, `/refactor`, `/audit`, `/doc`, `/finish`, `/upgrade` (reference: `.agents/commands.md`).
- Deterministic pipelines: `.agents/orchestration.md`. Closeout gate for non-trivial changes: `.agents/doc-sync-checklist.md`.

## Skills

See [the full guide](.agents/README.md) for details on our 26 specialized skills under `.agents/skills/`.

<!-- context7 -->
Use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation whenever the user asks about a library, framework, SDK, API, CLI tool, or cloud service -- even well-known ones like React, Next.js, Prisma, Express, Tailwind, Django, or Spring Boot. This includes API syntax, configuration, version migration, library-specific debugging, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage. Use even when you think you know the answer -- your training data may not reflect recent changes. Prefer this over web search for library docs.

Do not use for: refactoring, writing scripts from scratch, debugging business logic, code review, or general programming concepts.

## Steps

1. Always start with `resolve-library-id` using the library name and the user's question, unless the user provides an exact library ID in `/org/project` format
2. Pick the best match (ID format: `/org/project`) by: exact name match, description relevance, code snippet count, source reputation (High/Medium preferred), and benchmark score (higher is better). If results don't look right, try alternate names or queries (e.g., "next.js" not "nextjs", or rephrase the question). Use version-specific IDs when the user mentions a version
3. `query-docs` with the selected library ID and the user's full question (not single words)
4. Answer using the fetched docs

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
